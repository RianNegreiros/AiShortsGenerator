# Frontend Project

This project is a frontend for generating short videos using AI. It allows users to create new videos, preview them, and export them. The application uses `Next.js`, `TailwindCSS`, `shadcn`, `remotion`, `Axios`, and integrates with an API for content generation and video rendering.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18.x or above)
- API for video generation (Ensure your environment variables are correctly configured on backend/appsettings.Development.json)

## Installation

```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Environment Variables

Before starting the app, make sure you configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```plaintext
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<Your API URL>
  REMOTION_AWS_SERVE_URL=<Your AWS Serve URL for Remotion>
```

To get the AWS Serve URL follow this [guide](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup) from the remotion docs

## Development

To run the application in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app on http://localhost:3000 by default. You can modify the port by setting the PORT environment variable.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Dependencies

- **Next.js**: React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.
- **Remotion**: Library for creating videos programmatically with React.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making requests to the API.
- **shadcn**: A collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

## Usage

1. **Dashboard**: Users can view and manage generated short videos.
2. **Create New Video**: Users can define the video topic, style, and duration, and the app will generate the video content, audio, captions, and images using AI.
3. **Video Preview, Export & Delete**: After the video is generated, users can preview it in the dialog and export it once rendered or deleted it.
